<h1 align="center">Pygame Divider</h1>

<p align="center"> As of recently, I have taken some interest in making graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using the python library, Pygame. That being said, there are still some skill gaps that I am looking to work on. On the other hand, I have been working on this step-by-step guide on division to teach the concept quickly. I aim to build past just the coverage of division and branch into the other core mathematical concepts. I could see this being useful for primary grade students that may encounter trouble understanding these problems in their classes.

## Contribution
- First and foremost, you will want to head to the *Issue* tab above and select one that appeals to your skillset. Once you have chosen one of them, I will be able to assign you to the specific issue so that you can begin working on it.
- Next, you will want to create a fork of this repo so that you can organize your changes. You can do this by pressing the fork button in the top right corner.
- Now, once you have made a **working state**, you can go into the *Pull Request* tab and create one from which you will be met with a guideline for your contribution description that you will be able to fill out accordingly.
- Finally, I would request that you provide comments within your code so that the rest of the contributors can make sense of your code blocks. Another important note is that I would prefer that you follow the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#:~:text=The%20Python%20standard%20library%20is,inside%20parentheses%2C%20brackets%20and%20braces.) standard when creating your changes to maintain uniformity.
 
## Local Testing
- Since this project is based on python and pygame those will be the only two requirements for this project. As such there is a quick documentation for the installation of [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) and for [python](https://medium.com/co-learning-lounge/how-to-download-install-python-on-windows-2021-44a707994013).
- Once you have those downloaded and accounted for in your python path you will be able to run the python file that is within the direcrtory directly. This will create a current state of the project based on the progress of the issues.

## Questions or Concerns
- You can leave anysort of comments that you feel necessary within the issue comment section and I will respond as soon as I possibly can! Have fun!
