<h1 align="center">Pygame Divider</h1>

<p align="center"> As of recently, I have taken some interest in making graphical user interphaces (GUIs) using the python library, Pygame. That being said, there are still some skill gaps that I am looking to work on. On the other hand, I have ben wokring on this step-by-step guide on division to provide a better understanding for the concept. My aim is to be able to build past just the coverage of division and dipping into the other core mathematical concepts. I could see this being useful for primary grade students that may encounter trouble understanding these problems in their classes.
